# Validation

GHEtool is validated in a couple of ways. The goal is to increase the number of validation documents in the future.

First of all, it is internally checked for coherence, meaning that different methodology give (more or less) the same
result.
Examples of this can be found in the validation files below.

Peere et al. (2021) validates the hybrid sizing method of GHEtool. The validation code can be found below.

The equivalent borehole thermal resistance is validated with the commercial software of Earth Energy Designer (EED) and
can be found here.

The deep sizing methodology, using a 1/depth assumption for the convergence of the borefield sizing when there is a
temperature gradient can be found here.

```

The methodologies used in GHEtool have been validated against 14 other sizing methods (based on the work of Ahmadfard
and Bernier (2019)), including the classic ASHRAE sizing equation and commercial tools such as EED, GLHEpro, and DTS.
The results and their interpretations from this comparison across four different cases can be found here.
