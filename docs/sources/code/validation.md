# Validation

GHEtool is validated in a couple of ways. The goal is to increase the number of validation documents in the future.

First of all, it is internally checked for coherence, meaning that different methodology give (more or less) the same result.
Examples of this can be found in the validation files below.

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1

Validation/sizing_method_comparison.rst
Validation/sizing_method_comparison_L2_L3_L4.rst
Validation/speed_comparison.rst
```

Secondly, a paper (about the hybrid L2 sizing method) validates one of the main sizing methods of GHEtool. It can be found herebelow.
```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1

Validation/cases.rst
```

The equivalent borehole thermal resistance is validated with the commercial software of Earth Energy Designer and can be found here.
