# Contribute to the GUI

This document contains all the information needed for someone who wants to add a method to the GUI of GHEtool.
It explains the general way the GUI is setup, how options can be added and how (new) translations can be included.
If you want to contribute to the general structure of the GUI, please look at [ScenarioGUI](https://github.com/tblanke/ScenarioGUI).
