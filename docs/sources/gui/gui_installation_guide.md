# Installation guide
To install the latest version of the graphical user interface of GHEtool, please visit the webpage of [GHEtool](http://ghetool.sysi.be/).

One can install the graphical user interface with and without the command line.
- Traditionally, the tool without the command line is the cleaner version. It just shows the graphical user interface, but no other (debug) messages.
- The version with command line gives you access to the code and functionalities in the background via command line. This means that if you choose to install GHEtool with command line, you have more flexibility in functionalities.
