## [2.2.0] - 2023-10-17

## Added
- Extra warning message if one wants to load a GHEtool file that was created with a newer version.
- Borehole thermal resistance is now visible at the borehole thermal resistance page (issue #51).

- Custom error when the field cannot be sized due to a ground temperature gradient (issue #156).
- Interpolation option in calculate function in Gfunction class (issue #159).
- Absolute and relative tolerances for the sizing methods even as a maximum number of iterations is added, so there is more transparency and flexibility in the trade-off between accuracy and speed (issue #159).
- Added advanced options to GHEtool GUI (issue #165).
- Added a result class so all calculated temperatures are now in a separate Result class object within the borefield object (issue #167).

- Pygfunction media object can be imported into the FluidData object in GHEtool (issue #174).
- Temperature and flux database (Europe) implemented (issue #178).
- Yearly heating/cooling load in LoadClass (issue #180).

## Changed
- GUI was moved to a separate project: [ScenarioGUI](https://github.com/tblanke/ScenarioGUI).
- H_init was removed from the sizing functions since it was not used.
- Rb is now solely handled by the borehole object.
- load_hourly_profile is moved to the separate load classes (issue #45).
- Removed 'set_hourly_cooling_load', 'set_hourly_heating_load' from main_class and move it to separate load class (issue #45).
- Moved draw_borehole_internals to PipeClass (issue #45).
- Borehole equivalent resistances is now calculated in one step, centralised in the pipe class (issue #45).
- Go to 100% code coverage with 350 tests.
- Threshold interpolation for g-functions set to a relative threshold of 25% relative to the demanded depth (issue #144).
- Implemented a custom error for crossing the maximum number of iterations: 'MaximumNumberOfIterations' (issue #144).
- _size_based_on_temperature_profile now returns two arguments: the required depth and a boolean flag to check if the field is sized (issue #144).
- Speed up of L3/L4 sizing by halving calculation time due to intermediate checks if the field is sized (issue #144).
- Changed ValueError when the field cannot be sized due to a temperature gradient to the custom UnsolvableDueToTemperatureGradient Exception (issue #156).
- Rename SizingSetup class to CalculationSetup class (issue #159).
- Move H_init to CalculationSetup class (issue #159).
- Move use_precalcated_data to CalculationSetup class and rename to: 'use_precalculate_dataset' (issue #159).
- Changed 'set_max_ground_temperature' and 'set_min_ground_temperature' to correct names: 'set_max_avg_fluid_temperature' and 'set_min_avg_fluid_temperature'
- Changed 'minimal average fluid temperature' to 'minimum average fluid temperature' in GUI (issue #172).
- Max value of SEER is now 1000 (issue #178).

## Fixed
- Fixed problem with L2 sizing, when the peak load was the same in all months (issue #146).
- Small bug in faster g-function calculation solved. When changing the borefield, the previously calculated g-functions where not removed.
- When using interpolation for the g-functions, the results could vary a little bit based on the previous sizings. By reinstating the H_init parameter, this is solved.
- Borehole internals can no longer overlap in the GUI.
- Optimise load profile crashes with small borefields (issue #180).


## [2.1.2] - 2023-04-28

### Added
- Logger for GHEtool (issue #96).
- Examples are now also in RTD.
- Reynolds number is shown on the result page (issue #112).
- Example for the combination of active and passive cooling (issue #114).
- It is now possible to use building loads (with a SCOP/SEER) instead of ground loads(issue #115).

### Changed
- In figure plotting, the interval[x[i], x[i+1]) now has the value y[i] (instead of y[i-1]).
- Scroll behaviour on the result page (issue #99).
- Changed icon of GHEtool.
- Imbalance changed to property so it can handle hourly loads as well (issue #106).
- Remove recalculation option (issue #109).
- When data is loaded in a two-column format, the button for 'two columns' is set (issue #133).
- GUI doesn't crash anymore when wrong seperator and decimal points are selected when loading a .csv.
- One can now use monthly calculations which do not assume equal month length.


### Fixed
- Sizing doesn't crash when either no heating or cooling load is present (issue #91).
- Wrong heating load in april in GUI (issue #94).
- Results are now cleared when new loads are loaded (issue #106).
- Options for g-function calculations are not working (issue #119).
- Wrong naming aim optimise load profile.
- GHEtool now can start after a crash without removing the backup file.
- Some translations were not correct.
- Solves issue with loading .csv file and optimise load profile (issue #130).
- Figure in optimize load profile keeps getting bigger and bigger (issue #131).
- Problem with sizing with temperature gradients (issue #136).
- Problem solved with calculate_multiple_scenarios.


## [2.1.1] - 2023-01-30

### Added
- Added NavigationToolbar to figure (issue #55).
- Added different peak lengths for heating and cooling separately (issue #72).
- Readable saving format for gui (JSON).
- A super class that contains functions relevant for all GHEtool classes.
- Exe can be installed either locally for one user without admin permission or for all users using admin permission.
- Saved files (*.GHEtool) can be loaded from GHEtool by double click.


### Changed
- Created a class for the custom g-functions (issue #57).
- Created a class for g-function calculation that stores the previously calculated g-values to speed up the iterative algorithms (issue #57).
- Created a class for sizing_setup to clean up the code.
The speed improvement is over a factor 10 for heavy iterative procedures (like optimise load profile). A full speed improvement report can be found under:
code version > speed improvements > v2.1.1.
- The sizing methods themselves are now faster due to the fact that only the first and last year are calculated (issue #44). For more info, one can check:
code version > speed improvements > v2.1.1.
- Faster loading time of the GUI.
- Further documentation for optimise_load_profile functionality.
- Smaller exe-file size by setting up a virtual environment and using a pyinstall folder instead of a single file.

### Fixed
- The hourly_heating_load_on_the_borefield and hourly_cooling_load_on_the_borefield are now correctly calculated.
- When an hourly temperature profile is plotted after an optimise_load_profile optimisation, the hourly load on the borefield (and not the entire hourly load) is shown.
- Correct conversion from hourly to monthly load (issue #62).
- Problem with np.float16 when using simulation periodes >80 years due to overflow errors.
- Implemented FIFO-class to prevent cycling in iterative sizing.
- A scenario name cannot occur twice in the scenario list.
- Sometimes some gui options were not shown.
- The drag-and-drop behaviour of the scenario list is fixed (issue #80).
- The renaming of a scenario was not possible (issue #86).
- Problems with borehole internals and pipe overlaps.
