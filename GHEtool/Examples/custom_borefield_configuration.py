"""
This file gives an example on how to work with a custom borefield within GHEtool using pygfunction.

When working on a custom borefield configuration, one needs to import this configuration into the GHEtool.
Based on the pygfunction, one creates his custom borefield and gives it as an argument to the class initiater Borefield of GHEtool.

You also need a custom g-function file for interpolation. This can also be given as an argument to the class initiater as _custom_gfunction.
This custom variable, must contain gfunctions for all time steps in Borefield.DEFAULT_TIME_ARRAY, and should be structured as follows:
{"Time":Borefield.DEFAULT_TIME_ARRAY,"Data":[[Depth1,[Gfunc1,Gfunc2 ...]],[Depth2,[Gfunc1, Gfunc2 ...]]]}.

However, one can use the function 'create_custom_dataset' when a custom borefield is given. This will make the required dataset for the optimisation.
