    ----------

        Borefield object

        Load data used for the optimisation.
    temperature_threshold : float
        The maximum allowed temperature difference between the maximum and minimum fluid temperatures and their
        respective limits. The lower this threshold, the longer the convergence will take.
    use_hourly_resolution : bool
        If use_hourly_resolution is used, the hourly data will be used for this optimisation. This can take some
        more time than using the monthly resolution, but it will give more accurate results.
    max_peak_heating : float
        The maximum peak power for the heating (building side) [kW]
    max_peak_cooling : float

    dhw_preferential : bool
        True if heating should first be reduced only after which the dhw share is reduced.
