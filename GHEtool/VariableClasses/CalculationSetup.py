        Parameters
        ----------
        quadrant_sizing : int
            Differs from 0 when a sizing in a certain quadrant is desired.
            Quadrants are developed by (Peere et al., 2021) [#PeereBS]_, [#PeereThesis]_
        L2_sizing : bool
            True if a sizing with the L2 method is needed
        L3_sizing : bool
            True if a sizing with the L3 method is needed
        L4_sizing : bool
            True if a sizing with the L4 method is needed
        atol : float
            Absolute tolerance between two consecutive depths in the sizing method,
            below which the iteration is stopped. False means that this tolerance is ignored.
        rtol : float
            Relative tolerance between two consecutive depths in the sizing method,
             below which the iteration is stopped. False means that this tolerance is ignored.
        max_nb_of_iterations : int
            Max number of iterations after which the iteration is stopped.
        interpolate_gfunctions : bool
            True if the g-functions may be interpolated. This can lead to some problems with time-invariant results,
            for if you run a sizing twice, the second time the algorithm can interpolate, so it (can) converge(s) to
            a slightly different result.
        H_init : float
            The initial borehole length for the different methods.
        use_precalculated_dataset : bool
            True if a precalculated dataset of g-function should be used.
        deep_sizing : bool
            When using a temperature gradient, sometimes the iterative algorithm will get stuck in a loop, returning
            an unsolvable error due to the maximum number of iterations. However, it can be that there is a solution
            anyways. By using another approach for sizing with a variable ground temperature, a solution can be found,
            however this method is slower. If deep_sizing is True, whenever an unsolvable error is returned, the
            sizing is done again with this other methodology.
        force_deep_sizing : bool
            True when deep_sizing should be done always
        use_neural_network : bool
            True if the neural network simplification should be used. This uses a NN trained on previous calculated
            gvalues.
